# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## 1. Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction of CVDs using clinical and lifestyle data can aid in timely intervention and better patient outcomes.  
This project utilizes a dataset derived from routine medical examinations to build a predictive model for cardiovascular disease.  
The aim is to explore the data, preprocess it effectively, engineer meaningful features, and apply machine learning models to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular conditions.

## 2. Data Description

### 2.1 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of **70,000** entries and **13 columns**, sourced from routine medical checkups.  
It is used for predicting the presence of cardiovascular disease (binary classification).

Each row represents data for one patient. The features include demographic information, physiological measurements, lifestyle choices, and the target variable `cardio`.

### 2.2 Features Description

| Column Name | Type  | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| `id`        | int   | Unique identifier for each record |
| `age`       | int   | Age in days (e.g., 19,468 days â‰ˆ 53.3 years) |
| `gender`    | int   | 1 = Female, 2 = Male |
| `height`    | int   | Height in centimeters |
| `weight`    | float | Weight in kilograms |
| `ap_hi`     | int   | Systolic blood pressure |
| `ap_lo`     | int   | Diastolic blood pressure |
| `cholesterol` | int | 1 = Normal, 2 = Above Normal, 3 = Well Above Normal |
| `gluc`      | int   | 1 = Normal, 2 = Above Normal, 3 = Well Above Normal |
| `smoke`     | int   | 0 = Non-smoker, 1 = Smoker |
| `alco`      | int   | 0 = Non-drinker, 1 = Alcohol consumer |
| `active`    | int   | 0 = Physically inactive, 1 = Physically active |
| `cardio`    | int   | Target variable: 0 = No disease, 1 = Has cardiovascular disease |

### 2.3 Notable Characteristics

- `age` is stored in **days** and should be converted to **years** for interpretability.  
- `gender` is encoded as: **1 = Female, 2 = Male**.  
- `ap_hi` and `ap_lo` (blood pressure values) may contain **outliers or data entry errors** and should be carefully cleaned.  
- `cholesterol` and `gluc` are **ordinal features** (1 to 3).  
- The dataset is **balanced** and has **no missing values**.
